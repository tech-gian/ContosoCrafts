# ContosoCrafts

## Website
  This project is just an ASP.NET Core application, created with the instructions of Microsoft's official tutorials. It uses all the basic principles of MVC.
  
  Its content is about some crafts, displayed as cards, with a star rating-system, so we can see the usage of web APIs and how they are implemented in .NET Core.
